				<p>have you ever tried to hack your perception of time? i think many of us have, and one of the most common ways to do so is: set your clock to be ten minutes fast, relative to most other clocks. the hope is that by doing so you will be Always On Time.</p>
				<p>(un)fortunately, you are smarter than a clock! you wake up the next day, and see the time. perhaps a moment of the desired effect arises, but it quickly passes as you remember 'ah! of course, the time is ten minutes earlier than this clock says it is. indeed, i shall choose to allot myself an additional ten minutes to do whatever.' and thus, your plot is foiled.  </p>
				<p>it is the express goal of Always On Time that your future plots go unfoiled, and to accomplish this aim we have made a clock that will wait until you have gone to sleep, and randomly raise it's relative rapidity.</p>
				<b>in short, thirty minutes after setting an alarm and clicking 'sleep', this clock will add somewhere between five and twenty minutes to the time. this will reset itself thirty minutes after you click 'awake'. we hope you like it!</b>
